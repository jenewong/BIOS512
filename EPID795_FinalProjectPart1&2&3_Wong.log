 178        The earliest week in the year in which a term birth can occur is the 38th week. For this study, births that
 179        ocurred on or after the first day of the 38th week are term.
 180        The latest week in the year in which a preterm birth can occur is 17th week. There are 53 weeks in the year
 181        2015. The study consists of births with the entire 17-week risk period for preterm birth occurring within
 182        the year 2015. Since the 37th week of gestation is the last week of the risk period for preterm birth,
 183        53-37+1 = 17th week.;
